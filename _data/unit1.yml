- f: v = \frac{d}{\Delta t}
  n:  Calculate constant velocity.

- f:  v_f = v_i +at
  n:  Change in velocity is equal to acceleration x time.

- f:  \Delta d = v_it + \frac{1}{2}at^2
  n:  Quadratic equation for object undergoing acceleration.

- f:  t=\frac{-V_i \pm \sqrt{V_i^2+2a \Delta d}}{a}
  n:  Quadratic formula, time when projectile hits the ground.

- f:  \Delta d = \frac{v_i+v_f}{2}
  n:  Find distance travelled based on acerage velocity.

- f:  t=\sqrt{\frac{2 \Delta d}{a}}
  n:  If initial velocity is zero, easy way to solve for time.
  
- f:  v_f^2 = v_i^2+2a \Delta d
  n:  Square proportionality between both velocities, acceleration and distance travelled.
