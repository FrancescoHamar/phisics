# About Phisics

[Phisics.tech](https://phisics.tech) is a website with the aim of teaching physics through simulations. Physics is often hard to conceptualize with just long... words... and f0rmu1a5. The best way to experience it is in real life. This project intends on showing those real life phenomena in a controlled, accessible, and predictable environment. Have fun!

# Contribution
## Framework
* The website runs on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* Simulations run on [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) using javascript.
* Styling done with [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/).
* Math formatting done with [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/#gettingstarted)
* All icons from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

## How to contribute

Most helpful contributions would be adding more simulations. You can easily develop them on p5's online editor, [editor.p5js.org](https://editor.p5js.org/). Preferably just create a pull request with the p5.js file and I will incorporate it into the website as a whole. Include explanations and formulas too if you want!

If you want to run the webpage locally on your computer, you need to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). For this, install ruby, then run the project.

```
$ gem install bundler jekyll
$ bundle exec jekyll serve // run in root directory
```
