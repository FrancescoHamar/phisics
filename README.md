# Phisics

[Phisics.tech](https://phisics.tech) is a website with the aim of teaching physics through simulations. Physics is often hard to conceptualize with just long... words... and f0rmu1a5. The best way to experience it is in real life. This project intends on showing those real life phenomena in a controlled, accessible, and predictable environment. Have fun!

# Contribution
Most helpful contributions would be more simulations on the units covered. Equally as helpful would be better explanations of the physics behind the simulations. New units would also help a lot! Please create a GH issue for anything you want to add! I'm new to open source so any feedback would also be appreciated.
