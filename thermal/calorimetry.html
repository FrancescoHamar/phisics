          <h3>Heat is just thermal energy (think back to potential and kinetic energy). It is dependent on the mass of the substance,
          its specific heat capacity (a constant per material type, ex. cardboard is used on coffee cups because they have high heat capacities), and temperature.

          <h3>
          When a change in state occurs, such as melting, more energy is required to make that "jump" known as latent heat. This is known as the energy required to change the state of 1kg of a given material.</h3>

          To find that final temperature, we can simply set the heat lost by the hotter object equal to negative heat gained by the cooler object.</h3>

          ice melting and water freezing cannot happen in the same process.</h5>
