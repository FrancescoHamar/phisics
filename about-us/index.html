        <h1>What is this?</h1>
        <p>This is a platform to make teaching and learning physics easier. It is organized in the units of
        IB Physics HL, but is universal to all high school level physics curricula.</p>

        <p>In the making of this website, I was heavily inspired and mentored by my teachers, namely <strong> Mr. Cardenas</strong>,
          my IB Physics teacher, as well as <strong>Mr. Cavagnolo</strong>, my Computer Science teacher, and <strong>Mr. Betancourt</strong>, my IB Math teacher!
        Thank you so much for making this possible.</p>
